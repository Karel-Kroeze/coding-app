    "manipulation": "Does the tested relationship involve a manipulation? (i.e. is the student purposefully manipulating one variable to measure the effect on another?)",

    "qualified": "Is the hypothesis fully qualified? (i.e. are the conditions under which the hypothesis is tested made explicit - e.g. in a series/parallel circuit).",

    "testable": "Is the hypothesis testable? (e.g. can the variables involved be manipulated, controlled and measured?)",
    "specific": "Does the hypothesis state a clear and specific test and expected outcome?"
